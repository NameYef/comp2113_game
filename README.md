## To-do (in order)
Must finish pre-game before doing the rest

### 1, Finalize board design (how the board is initialized) 
DONE
### 2, Work on Pre-game (should take the most time)
Details:

Bot player board set up 

Player board set up 

Complete pre-game game state 

### 3, Fundamental gameplay (may look more work than pre-game but much easier to implement)
Details:

Handle player switching 

handle attack coordinates and ship destroying 

check win condition 

update game status (which ship being destroyed? destroyed how many %?) 

Additional features to enrich gameplay 

Score system (can be discarded)

### 4, Post-game and finalization
Details:

Save best score and info about last match (to fulfill file I/O requirement, can be discarded if file I/O can be achieved somewhere else)

make a menu (e.g. play, see record, tutorial)

Make the game replayable (i.e. no need to relaunch everytime to play)
